This Algorithm Visualizer contains:   
- A Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer that uses the A* Pathfinding Algorithm to find the shortest path between a start node and end node, taking into account walls and the possibility of there being no path.  
- An Array Sorting Algorithm Visualizer for Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort.  
- A Sudoku Solving Visualizer that walks through the recursive backtracking algorithm of a sudoku board (defaults to a blank board, but will solve valid board templates inputted by the user).  
- A Binary Search Visualizer for a 1D array.
